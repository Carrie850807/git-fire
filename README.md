# `git-fire üî•`

### [Inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/)

`git-fire` is a Git plugin that **helps in the event of an emergency** by adding all current files, committing, and pushing to a new branch (to prevent merge conflicts).

**Alias it to [`git out`](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/cvmxnv1) or [`git going`](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/cvmsajb) for comedic effect.**

## Installation

Just copy `git-fire` to your `$PATH` and ensure it is an executable (`chmod +x git-fire`) and you're good to go. üëç

Also make sure you have Git installed.
